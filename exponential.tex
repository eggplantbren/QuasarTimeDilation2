Let the probability density be a mixture of two parts: a regular exponential
distribution on the right hand side, and a reversed exponential distribution on
the left hand side. Suppose it is centered at a median value $x=\mu$, and
has a scale length of $\beta_l$ on the left and $\beta_r$ on the right.
Therefore the probability density is given by
\begin{align}
p(x) &= \left\{
    \begin{array}{lr}
    \frac{1}{2\beta_l}\exp\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\beta_l} \right), & x < \mu \\
    \frac{1}{2\beta_r}\exp\left(-\left[\frac{x-\mu}{\beta_r}\right]\right),
                                & x \geq \mu \\
    \end{array}
    \right.
\end{align}
This distribution already has 50\% probability on
each side, which is one of our requirements.
We now need to find the formulas for setting $\beta_l$ and $\beta_r$ based on
the 16\% and 84\% quantiles, which are given.

For a standard Exponential(1) distribution, the inverse CDF is
\begin{align}
F^{-1}(u) &= -\log(1 - u),
\end{align}
and we are looking for the 68\% quantile of this distribution.
This occurs at
\begin{align}
x &= -\log(1 - 0.68) \\
  &\approx 1.1394.
\end{align}
Therefore, 68\% of the mass of the double exponential distribution is
contained between $\mu-1.1394\beta_l$ and $\mu + 1.1394\beta_r$.
If we are given the credible interval $[x_l, x_r]$ we can solve for the
$\beta$s using
\begin{align}
\beta_l &= \frac{\mu - x_l}{1.1394} \\
\beta_r &= \frac{x_r - \mu}{1.1394}.
\end{align}
