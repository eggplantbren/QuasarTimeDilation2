* The uncertainties on the bolometric luminosities are very small.
To quantify this, the mean errorbar is 0.018, but the standard deviation of
all the (log10) lbol values is 0.450.

* Including MBH in the explanatory variables makes Lbol irrelevant, but reduces
the marginal likelihood slightly. The inference about n is not affected
significantly.

* As you might expect, taking Lbol out of the model increases the marginal
likelihood. We might be able to proceed with Mbh in and Lbol out.

* With MBH replacing LBol, the marginal likelihood is better without the
interaction term, and with the term, its value is basically consistent with zero.
