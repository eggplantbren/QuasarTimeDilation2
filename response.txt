* The uncertainties on the bolometric luminosities are very small.
To quantify this, the mean errorbar is 0.018, but the standard deviation of
all the (log10) lbol values is 0.450.

* Including MBH in the explanatory variables makes Lbol irrelevant, but reduces
the marginal likelihood slightly. The inference about n is not affected
significantly.
